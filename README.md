## Disclaimer
1. Verified token does not mean the project is in partnership with KardiaChain
2. We do not verify the functions that develop on the token contract (eg: mint() function of the token's owner, pause() transfer or trading forbidden...)
3. We do not verify other source codes, smart contracts that implementation on top of the token contract.
4. We do not guarantee the business model of the projects or behaviors of the token's owner.
5. Unverified token does not mean the token is not legit, token's owner can still verify the source code of the token contract without adding logo.
6. Do your own research and invest at your own risk.
7. We reserve the right to take down any reported scam, fraud projects.
